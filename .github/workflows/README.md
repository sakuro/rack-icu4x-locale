# Ruby Gem Release Workflows

GitHub Actions workflows for automating Ruby gem releases using RubyGems Trusted Publishing (OIDC authentication).

## Overview

These workflows provide a complete CI/CD pipeline for Ruby gems:

1. **CI Workflow** - Continuous integration testing
2. **Release Preparation** - Automated release branch and PR creation
3. **Release Validation** - Pre-merge release checks
4. **Release Publishing** - Automated gem publishing to RubyGems.org
5. **Update Ruby Versions** - Automated Ruby version maintenance

## Workflows

### 1. CI Workflow (`ci.yml`)

Runs tests and quality checks across multiple Ruby versions.

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` branch
- Pull requests

**Matrix Testing:**
- Tests against all maintained Ruby versions
- Ruby versions are defined in the workflow's matrix configuration
- See [Ruby Maintenance Branches](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/) for current supported versions

**Steps:**
- Checks out code
- Sets up Ruby with bundler cache
- Runs `bundle exec rake` (default task)

### 2. Release Preparation Workflow (`release-preparation.yml`)

Creates a release branch with updated version files and opens a pull request.

**Trigger:**
- Manual dispatch with version input (e.g., `1.0.0`)

**Actions:**
- Creates release branch `release-v{version}`
- Updates `lib/{gem_name}/version.rb` with new version
- Updates `CHANGELOG.md`:
  - Converts `[Unreleased]` to versioned section with date
  - Adds new `[Unreleased]` section for future changes
- Creates git tag `v{version}`
- Pushes branch and tag to remote
- Creates pull request with detailed checklist

**Requirements:**
- Repository permissions: `contents: write`, `pull-requests: write`

### 3. Release Validation Workflow (`release-validation.yml`)

Validates release PRs to ensure everything is correct before merging.

**Trigger:**
- Pull requests to `main` branch (only for `release-v*` branches)

**Ruby Version:**
- Uses the minimum supported Ruby version

**Validations:**
- Version format (must be `x.y.z`)
- Version consistency between branch name and `version.rb`
- Git tag existence check
- RubyGems version availability check
- CHANGELOG.md format validation

**Special Features:**
- Automatically updates git tag to latest commit when PR is updated
- Ensures tagged commit is always the one that will be published

**Requirements:**
- Repository permissions: `contents: write`

### 4. Release Publishing Workflow (`release-publish.yml`)

Publishes the gem to RubyGems.org and creates a GitHub release when a release PR is merged.

**Trigger:**
- Pull request closure (only when merged and from `release-v*` branches)

**Ruby Version:**
- Uses the minimum supported Ruby version

**Actions:**
- Extracts version from branch name
- Checks out the release tag
- Builds gem with `bundle exec rake build`
- Configures RubyGems credentials using Trusted Publishing
- Pushes gem to RubyGems.org
- Extracts version-specific changelog
- Creates GitHub release with changelog and gem file

**Requirements:**
- Repository permissions: `contents: write`, `id-token: write`
- Environment: `release` (configured in GitHub repository settings)
- RubyGems Trusted Publishing configured

### 5. Update Ruby Versions Workflow (`update-ruby-versions.yml`)

Automatically maintains Ruby version configuration with the latest maintained Ruby versions.

**Triggers:**
- Scheduled: Twice a year during January 2-8 and April 2-8 at a repository-specific time (set during initialization)
- Manual dispatch

**Actions:**
- Fetches maintained Ruby versions from [Ruby's official branches.yml](https://github.com/ruby/www.ruby-lang.org/blob/master/_data/branches.yml)
- Updates Ruby version configuration in multiple files:
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` test matrix
  - `.github/workflows/release-*.yml` ruby-version
  - `.rubocop.yml` TargetRubyVersion
  - `*.gemspec` required_ruby_version
  - `README.md` Ruby version requirement
  - `mise.toml` ruby version
- Creates a pull request if changes are detected

**Schedule Optimization:**
- Aligned with Ruby's predictable release schedule:
  - New Ruby versions are released on December 25th
  - Ruby versions reach EOL on March 31st
- Runs daily during January 2-8 and April 2-8 (1-week window to capture updates)
- Reduces API calls by 98% (from 365/year to 14/year) while ensuring reliable updates
- Repository-specific time (e.g., 13:23 UTC) distributes API load across different repositories
- Workflow is idempotent: only creates PRs when changes are detected

**Configuration:**
- Schedule is automatically set to a unique time per repository during initialization
- Automatically excludes EOL (End of Life) Ruby versions
- Manual triggers remain available via workflow_dispatch for immediate updates when needed

**Requirements:**
- Repository permissions: `contents: write`, `pull-requests: write`

## Initial Setup

### Automated Configuration

The initialization script automatically configures:

**Repository Settings** (`https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/settings/actions`):
- **Workflow permissions**: Set to "Read and write permissions"
- **Pull request permissions**: Enable "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

**GitHub Environment** (`https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/settings/environments`):
- Creates `release` environment for deployment protection

### RubyGems Trusted Publishing

Configure OIDC authentication for secure, token-less gem publishing:

1. Go to https://rubygems.org/oidc/pending_trusted_publishers
2. Create a new pending trusted publisher with:
   - **Gem name**: `{your_gem_name}`
   - **Repository owner**: `{github_username}`
   - **Repository name**: `{repository_name}`
   - **Workflow filename**: `release-publish.yml`
   - **Environment name**: `release`

3. The pending publisher will automatically convert to an active publisher after the first successful gem push.

**Note:** Trusted Publishing works seamlessly with MFA enabled on RubyGems.org. You can safely use "UI and API" MFA level without breaking CI/CD.

## Project Structure

Ensure your project has the following structure:

```
your-gem/
├── lib/
│   └── {gem_name}/
│       └── version.rb        # Contains VERSION constant
├── CHANGELOG.md              # Keep a Changelog format
├── Rakefile                  # With build task
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        ├── ci.yml
        ├── release-preparation.yml
        ├── release-validation.yml
        ├── release-publish.yml
        └── update-ruby-versions.yml
```

**version.rb** should contain:
```ruby
module YourGem
  VERSION = "0.1.0"
end
```

**CHANGELOG.md** should follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format:
```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- New feature descriptions

## [0.1.0] - 2024-01-15
- Initial release
```

**Rakefile** provides the following tasks:
- `rake` or `rake default` - Run tests and RuboCop (default task)
- `rake spec` - Run RSpec tests
- `rake rubocop` - Run RuboCop linter
- `rake doc` - Generate YARD API documentation
- `rake clean` - Remove temporary files (coverage, .rspec_status, .yardoc)
- `rake clobber` - Remove all generated files (doc/api, pkg)
- `rake build` - Build gem package (from bundler/gem_tasks)
- `rake install` - Build and install gem locally (from bundler/gem_tasks)

Note: Do NOT use `rake release` as it conflicts with this template's release workflow tagging policy. Use the GitHub Actions release workflow instead (see Release Procedure below).

## Release Procedure

### Step 1: Prepare for Release

1. Ensure all changes are merged to `main` branch
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with changes in the `[Unreleased]` section
3. Commit and push changes to `main`

### Step 2: Trigger Release Preparation

**Option A: Using GitHub UI**

1. Go to Actions tab in your repository
2. Select "Release Preparation" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter the version number (e.g., `1.0.0`)
5. Click "Run workflow"

**Option B: Using GitHub CLI**

```bash
gh workflow run release-preparation.yml -f version=1.0.0
```

The workflow will:
- Create a release branch
- Update version files
- Create a git tag
- Open a pull request

### Step 3: Review the Release PR

**Finding the Pull Request:**

```bash
# Find PR for the release branch
gh pr list --head release-v1.0.0

# Or view it directly in the browser
gh pr view --web --head release-v1.0.0
```

1. Review the automatically created pull request
2. Check the "Files changed" tab to verify:
   - `version.rb` has the correct version
   - `CHANGELOG.md` has the correct date and format
3. CI and validation workflows will run automatically
4. Review the checklist in the PR description

**Important:** If you push new commits to the release branch, the validation workflow will automatically update the git tag to point to the latest commit.

### Step 4: Merge and Publish

**Finding and Merging the Release PR:**

```bash
# Check PR status and CI results
gh pr view release-v1.0.0

# Check if all checks have passed
gh pr checks release-v1.0.0

# Get PR number and branch name for merge commit message
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view release-v1.0.0 --json number -q .number)
BRANCH_NAME=$(gh pr view release-v1.0.0 --json headRepositoryOwner,headRefName -q '.headRepositoryOwner.login + "/" + .headRefName')

# Merge the PR with proper commit message
gh pr merge release-v1.0.0 --merge --subject ":inbox_tray: Merge pull request #$PR_NUMBER from $BRANCH_NAME"

# Or use other merge strategies (if project conventions require):
# gh pr merge release-v1.0.0 --squash   # Squash and merge
# gh pr merge release-v1.0.0 --rebase   # Rebase and merge
```

**Option: Using GitHub UI**

1. Once all checks pass and requirements are met, merge the PR from the GitHub web interface

**After Merging:**

The Release Publishing workflow will automatically:
- Build the gem from the tagged commit
- Publish to RubyGems.org using Trusted Publishing
- Create a GitHub release with changelog and gem file

### Step 5: Verify Publication

1. Check RubyGems.org: `https://rubygems.org/gems/{gem_name}`
2. Check GitHub releases: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/releases`
3. Verify the published version: `gem list {gem_name} --remote`

## Troubleshooting

### Release Preparation Fails

**Problem:** "Version already exists on RubyGems"
- **Solution:** The version has already been published. Use a higher version number.

**Problem:** "Git tag already exists"
- **Solution:** The tag was created outside the release process. Delete it or use a different version.

### Release Validation Fails

**Problem:** "Version mismatch"
- **Solution:** Ensure the version in `version.rb` matches the version in the branch name.

**Problem:** "CHANGELOG.md missing section"
- **Solution:** Ensure CHANGELOG.md has a section for the release version.

### Release Publishing Fails

**Problem:** "Trusted Publishing authentication failed"
- **Solution:** Verify the pending trusted publisher configuration on RubyGems.org matches your repository settings.

**Problem:** "Missing permissions"
- **Solution:** Check that repository workflow permissions are set to "Read and write permissions".

**Problem:** "Environment not found"
- **Solution:** Create the `release` environment in repository settings.

## Security Considerations

- **No API tokens required**: Trusted Publishing uses OIDC, eliminating the need for long-lived API tokens
- **MFA compatible**: Works seamlessly with RubyGems MFA requirements
- **Principle of least privilege**: Workflows only request necessary permissions
- **Tag immutability**: Once a release is published, the git tag represents the exact code that was published

## Maintenance

### Ruby Version Management

Ruby versions are automatically managed by the `update-ruby-versions.yml` workflow.

**Automatic Updates:**
- The workflow runs twice yearly and fetches the latest maintained Ruby versions from [Ruby's official branches.yml](https://github.com/ruby/www.ruby-lang.org/blob/master/_data/branches.yml)
- Automatically updates Ruby version configuration in multiple files:
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` test matrix
  - `.github/workflows/release-*.yml` ruby-version
  - `.rubocop.yml` TargetRubyVersion
  - `*.gemspec` required_ruby_version
  - `README.md` Ruby version requirement
  - `mise.toml` ruby version
- Creates a pull request when changes are detected
- All workflows (CI, release validation, and release publishing) use these updated versions

**Manual Updates:**
You can manually trigger the update workflow:

```bash
# Using GitHub CLI
gh workflow run update-ruby-versions.yml
```

**Ruby Version Configuration:**
- **Minimum version**: The oldest maintained Ruby version (e.g., 3.2)
- **CI test matrix**: All maintained Ruby versions (e.g., ["3.2", "3.3", "3.4"])
- **Typical count**: 3-4 versions simultaneously maintained

**Note:** When a new Ruby version is released (e.g., Ruby 3.5 in December 2024), there will temporarily be 4 versions until the oldest version reaches EOL.

**Update Schedule:**
The workflow runs twice a year during two 1-week windows: Dec 25-31 and Apr 1-7, aligned with Ruby's predictable release schedule:
- New Ruby versions are released on December 25th (checked during Dec 25-31)
- Ruby versions reach EOL on March 31st (checked during Apr 1-7)

The 1-week window provides flexibility to capture updates after Ruby's release dates. The workflow is idempotent and only creates PRs when changes are detected, so multiple runs during the window cause no issues.

The specific time (e.g., 13:23 UTC) is automatically set during initialization to distribute API load across different repositories. This schedule reduces API calls by 98% (from 365/year to 14/year) while ensuring reliable updates after Ruby's regular release and EOL dates.

For immediate updates outside the regular schedule, use `gh workflow run update-ruby-versions.yml` or the Actions tab on GitHub.

**Important:** When the minimum Ruby version changes (e.g., when Ruby 3.2 reaches EOL), the workflows will automatically use the new minimum version. Ensure your gem's code is compatible with the updated Ruby versions.
